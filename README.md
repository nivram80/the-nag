# The Nag
The Nag is a **Rails** To-Do/Reminder application created by a group of [Omaha Code School](http://omahacodeschool.com/) students (see the contributors [here](https://github.com/nivram80/the-nag/graphs/contributors)).  A user can create a to-do list for several different events and the application, using [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/), will send them texts to reminding them of their uncompleted tasks.  

It is a little rough on the edges but an impressive effort since it was both their first Rails collaborative effort and it was completed in **4 days**.
